# HarvestGoogleCalendar

`v. 0.0.8`

This is a tool for harvesting information from [Google Calendar](http://google.com/calendar) into the [Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com/) time tracking system. The tool basically;

 1. Looks up all your Harvest entries for a given time period
 2. Filters the entries retaining only those where the `notes` field contains a "harvested:<eventid>" string - these are the entries already linked to Google Calendar events.
 3. Looks up all your Google Calendar events for the same time period.
 4. Finds obsolete Harvest entries and new events to insert and prompts the user to perform these updates, deletes or creates of Harvest entries.

The new events are found by matching each event against a set of configurable mappings (described under the "configuration file" section).

## Install

Get [node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/), then:

    $ npm install harvestgoogle

## How To Run

Options can either be given as command-line arguments, input into a YAML configuration file or be input when prompted.
  
    Usage: harvestgoogle.coffee [options]

    Options:

    -V, --version                       output the version number
    -c, --configuration [file]          Location of configuration file.

    -c, --calendar [calendar]           Name of Google Calendar
    -r, --range [YYYYMMDD]..[YYYYMMDD]  A timerange

## Configuration file

The configuration file is a YAML document containing arguments to the process *(optional)* and a set of mappings.
Each mapping interpreted as so:

 * *name* gives a name to the mapping,
 * *task_id* indicates which kind of Harvest task to create an entry,
 * *project_id* indicates into which Harvest project the entry should be created,
 * *rules* is a collection of key-value pairs where the key denotes a property on an event, while the value is the regular expression which must be matched by the property

And example could be:

    - name: Breakfasts at Tiffany's
      project_id: 123456
      task_id: 654321
      rules: 
      - summary: "[Bb]reakfast"
      - location: "Tiffany"

Which, when run, will create Harvest entries in with the given task + project corresponding to all events which contain "Breakfast" or "breakfast" in the title (summary) and a location which contains "Tiffany".

## Changelog
